* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  * REMITLY was founded as a solution to simplify international money transfers and payments, reducing or eliminating fees and really easing the process to get the money overseas, either in cash or directly to a bank account at the destination. In the beginning, they were focused on helping people in America transferring money to Philippines, but nowadays they have a much broader offer, supporting transactions from around 16 different developed countries to around 44 developing countries.

    The three founders of REMITLY have experienced directly the difficulties of sending money overseas, paying high fees, and having to wait long periods of time to get the money at destination. So, they decided to provide REMITLY as a tool, mainly for people living abroad, far away from their home countries, who want to send money to family and friends overseas, generally to developing countries.

    According to Matt Oppenheimmer, the size of the remittance industry is about $500 billion per year, with fees of around 8% which is $40 billion. That is a huge amount of money, paid directly by people in need of sending a few amounts to relatives and friends on a regular basis. REMITLY is definitely disrupting that market.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

  * REMITLY has risen $312 million dollars in Equity investments since its beginning, and $85 million dollars in debt, all based in a very conservative valuation of around $1 billion dollars.

    Among the vast number of investors are the following ones:

    * Generation which is an investment firm co-founded by Al Gore
    * Swiss asset manager Schroders
    * Naspers’ PayU
    * Stripes Group

    The fresh resources gotten by REMITLY are going to be used to fund transfers in developing countries ($85 million dollars in debt), so transactions can be done in almost instantly, and to fund further expansion and new projects ($135 million dollars - Equity).

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  * The high cost of money transfers, done mainly by inmigrants, from developed countries to developing countries is the main problem that REMITLY intends to solve. Also, the agility in money transfers is another key aspect they are focused on.

    On average, the cost of ending small amounts of money to developing countries if around 7% in 2019, according to the World Bank’s Remittance Prices Worldwide database.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

  * Main Customers target are the inmigrants living in developed countries sending money to their home countries, generally developing countries.

    According to the WorldBank, "annual remittance flows to low-and middle-income countries reached $529 billion in 2018, an increase of 9.6 percent over the previous record high of $483 billion in 2017. Global remittances, which include flows to high-income countries, reached $689 billion in 2018, up from $633 billion in 2017". Those remittances to low-and middle-income countries are the target market for REMITLY.

    REMITLY, as it's based on mobile-virtual technologies, can reduce the overall cost of transactions compared with direct competitors having physical presence and offices in many different places.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

  * REMITLY is in the Payments/Billing Fintech domain.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

  * During the last decade, the banking business, in general, has had a huge change due to the technology used to support the business. We have seen the evolution, from technology used as pure support for some transactions and automation (10 years ago) to the strategic usage of technology by banks to run the entire business. Nowadays technology is no longer just a support area in the banks but became a strategic piece of the business. Big Data, Blockchain, IoT, Cloud, AI, and Cybersecurity are being used in financial institutions to transform the markets. Physical banks are becoming obsolete, and being replaced by virtual ones, offering much better user experience, security, and controls. Definitely banks are changing and evolving thanks to the FinTech revolution... According to Citibank estimations, around 30 percent of banking employees are going to lose their jobs over the next decade. That is a clear sign of the huge transformation we are living in banking. 

    Payments and money transfers, where REMITRLY is mainly focused on, is one of the most transformed and evolved areas in financial markets during the last decade. We have seen the evolution from using mostly cash for payments and money transfers in general to the wide usage of electronic cards (Debit/Credit/Prepaid) to perform transactions, displacing cash transactions, and currently, we see the usage of wearables/contactless devices, smartphones, and tablets as main way to manage payments and money transfers, disrupting the physical-traditional banks market.
